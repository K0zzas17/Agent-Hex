# Hex-Bot agent via Algorithms
Using Various Reinforcement Learning / Searching algorithms to navigate an agent through various hexagonal maps
The respective README files will explain how to run the system, and visualise how the algorithms change the bot's trajectory

A1: UCS and A* Search Algorithms

A2: Markov Decision Processes using Value and Policy Iteration

A3: MDPs using Reinforcement learning algorithms Q-Learning and SARSA
